There are two parts to this program. The first part consists of 4 short scripts:
	master.sh, available.sh, expect_available.sh and parse_scritps.sh.
These scripts are used to create a file of the form of "final". This program is run by simply executing the master.sh program.
This will be set up with cron to run every 5-10 minutes to produce a fresh file.

The second part of this program (ssh.sh) is a little script that will be used by students to ssh into the machine with the least CPU usage. This will be exposed as a simple command line application for students to invoke.
